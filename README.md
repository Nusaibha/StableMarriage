Descriptiom: This project is a C++ implementation of the Stable Marriage Problem, a classic algorithmic challenge in which the goal is to find a stable matching between two equally sized sets of elements—typically men and women—based on their preferences. In this program, the preferences of three men and three women are hardcoded into matrices. The solution explores all possible pairings using a brute-force backtracking algorithm to identify those that are stable, meaning no two people would prefer each other over their current partners. The program includes a function to verify the stability of each pairing (ok()), which checks for conditions that would violate the stability requirement. If a match passes all stability checks, it is printed in a formatted output showing each man and his assigned partner. The output includes all valid, stable solutions for the given preferences. This project is ideal for students or developers who want to learn more about combinatorial problem-solving, backtracking algorithms, or classic computer science theory problems. It provides a hands-on approach to understanding how stability can be evaluated within matching problems and is useful for educational purposes or algorithm practice.
